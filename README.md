**Author's note: Trying to find Alpha in the world of alphabets and characters**

The depository is intended to research the effect of Twitter sentiment on environmental issues and the relationship with stock market activities. It is established in conjunction with Master's dissertation at London School of Economics (LSE) of the title _Agenda Setting: Twitter Discourse on Climate Change as Signal and Catalyst_.

It is divided into two parts:
1. Data collection (/twitter_scraping directory)
2. Data analyzation (/processing directory)
