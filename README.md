# ESG-Sentiment-Stocks

The depository is intended to research the effect of Twitter sentiment on environmental issues and the relationship with stock market activities.

It is divided into two parts:
1. Data collection (/twitter_scraping directory)
2. Data analyzation (/processing directory)

Note: Files in /data are ignored by git due to file sizes, please back up the data to other directories
